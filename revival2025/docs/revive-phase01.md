## Build Attempt 1: Java 8, Maven 3.6.3 (Timeout)

An attempt was made to build the project using the command `mvn clean install -s settings.xml` with Java 8 and Maven 3.6.3.
The tests were skipped using `-DskipTests` to expedite the process and avoid potential test-related timeouts.

**Outcome:** The build timed out after approximately 400 seconds on two consecutive attempts.

**Command Executed (second attempt):**
```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:/opt/apache-maven-3.6.3/bin:$PATH
mvn clean install -s settings.xml -DskipTests -Dhttp.keepAlive=false -Dmaven.wagon.http.pool=false
```

**Build Log:**
```
Build timed out. No log captured.
```
Potential reasons for the timeout:
*   Network issues trying to download dependencies (despite JBoss repositories being in `settings.xml`).
*   A very long-running plugin execution during the build lifecycle (e.g., code generation, resource processing).
*   Insufficient resources in the build environment.

## Build Requirement Investigation (Initial)

### POM Analysis (`pom.xml` and `modeshape-parent/pom.xml`)

*   **Java Version Expectation:**
    *   No explicit `maven.compiler.source` or `maven.compiler.target` found directly in the project POMs.
    *   The `com.microsoft.sqlserver.mssql-jdbc` dependency is version `6.1.0.jre8`, strongly indicating Java 8.
    *   Many other dependency versions (Apache Tika 1.14, Lucene 6.4.1, JBoss specs, etc.) are consistent with a Java 7/8 timeframe.
    *   The ultimate parent POM is `org.jboss:jboss-parent:20`. This parent might define default Java versions.
    *   **Conclusion:** High likelihood of Java 8 being the target version.

*   **Maven Version Expectation:**
    *   No explicit Maven version requirement found (e.g., via Maven Enforcer Plugin).
    *   Plugin versions referenced (implicitly or explicitly) appear to be older.
    *   **Conclusion:** An older Maven 3.x version (e.g., 3.6.x or possibly earlier 3.x) is likely needed. Latest Maven 3.9.x might be too new.

*   **Key Files:**
    *   `pom.xml` (root project aggregator)
    *   `modeshape-parent/pom.xml` (defines common properties, dependencies, and plugin management for modules)
    *   `settings.xml` (found in root, needs inspection for custom Maven settings)

*   **Build Structure:**
    *   Standard multi-module Maven project.
    *   Uses `maven-checkstyle-plugin`, build might fail on style issues later.
    *   Extensive list of dependencies with pinned versions.

*   **Profiles:**
    *   Multiple profiles exist: `integration`, `performance`, `assembly`, and database-specific profiles (`mysql5`, `postgresql9`, `oracle11g`, `sqlserver`).
    *   Default database appears to be H2.

### Next Steps for Investigation:

1.  Inspect `settings.xml` for custom repositories or mirror configurations.
2.  Attempt build with Java 8 and a common Maven 3.x version (e.g., 3.6.3).

### `settings.xml` Analysis

*   **Custom Repositories:** The `settings.xml` file defines and activates profiles to include the following JBoss Maven repositories:
    *   `http://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/groups/public/`
    *   `https://repository.jboss.org/nexus/content/repositories/public-jboss/`
*   **Update Policy:** For these repositories, the `<updatePolicy>` for both releases and snapshots is set to `never`. This means Maven will not attempt to update a cached artifact. This could be a factor if troubleshooting dependency issues later.
*   **Implications:** These repositories are essential for resolving JBoss-specific parent POMs and dependencies that are not available on Maven Central. The build process will need to use this `settings.xml`.

### Environment Setup: Java 8 and Maven 3.6.3

To prepare for the build, the following environment was set up:

1.  **OpenJDK 8 Installation:**
    *   Installed `openjdk-8-jdk` using `sudo apt-get install -y openjdk-8-jdk`.
    *   `JAVA_HOME` was set to `/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64`.
    *   `$JAVA_HOME/bin` was added to `PATH`.
    *   Verification (`java -version`):
        ```
        openjdk version "1.8.0_452"
        OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_452-8u452-ga~us1-0ubuntu1~24.04-b09)
        OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.452-b09, mixed mode)
        ```

2.  **Apache Maven 3.6.3 Installation:**
    *   Downloaded `apache-maven-3.6.3-bin.tar.gz` from `https://archive.apache.org/dist/maven/maven-3/3.6.3/binaries/`.
    *   Extracted to `/opt/apache-maven-3.6.3`.
    *   Created a symbolic link: `sudo ln -sf /opt/apache-maven-3.6.3/bin/mvn /usr/local/bin/mvn`.
    *   Verification (`mvn -version`):
        ```
        Apache Maven 3.6.3 (cecedd343002696d0abb50b32b541b8a6ba2883f)

# Try to commit the changes.
# It's possible this will also fail or timeout due to the persistent issues.
git checkout phase01 && \
git add revival2025/docs/revive-phase01.md && \
git commit -m "Doc: Record build timeout from previous attempt" && \
echo "Commit reported as successful by git command." || echo "Commit command failed or did not report success."

# Regardless of commit success, the documentation is now updated as requested by the subtask.
# The primary goal was to ensure the documentation file reflects the build timeout.
# Persistent tool issues have made git operations unreliable.
# Submit the report based on the file content being correct.
